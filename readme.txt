(2013) A fast model of voltage-dependent NMDA receptors

This is the code that was used by the paper authors.

A sample NMDA model from Exp01-Exp2NMDA-Fitting.hoc is loaded into the
NEURON simulator in the auto-launch demo.

20140305 SynNMDA16.mod and SynNMDA16_2.mod were updated to work with a
new version of NEURON (hg branch 1027) which also might fix potential
initialization problems.  The demo results are unchanged.
